The 10958 Problem
=================

(See https://youtu.be/pasyRUj7UwM)

The purpose of this program is to find a solution for the toy mathematical
problem of generating the number 10958 from the digits 1-9 in order, using only
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, parentheses,
and digit concatenation.

While Matt Parker feels free to treat digit concatenation as a generalized
function (first number × 10×floor(log10(second number) + 1) + second number), I would
like to avoid that if I can.
